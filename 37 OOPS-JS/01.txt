OOPS -> object oriennted programming

01.js 

to structure our code

when we see that data in objects in repeating then we tend to create templates

02.js

Object Prototypes : 

prototypes are mechenism by which JS objects inherit features from one another.

It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having their own copy

arr._proto_ (refrence)

Array.prototype (actual object)

String.prototype

03.js

factory functions -> a function that creates objects

04.js

new operator 
the new operator lets the devdloper create an instance of a user-defined object type or one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

05.js

Classes in JS

classes are a template for creating objects

the constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of the class

06.js

Inheritance

inheritance is a mechenism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes
