NODE JS

this is a JS runtime enviornment
it is used for server side programming

NODE js is not a language, library or framework

VS code is built on node js

NODE REPL

read evaluate print loop

we can use the node REPL in terminal and run js code

NODE FILES

we can run the JS files by node "filename"

01.js

PROCESS

process : this object provides the info about, and control over, the current node js process.

process.argv: returns an array containing the command-line argumrnts passed when the Node js process was launched

02.js

EXPORT

module.exports

require() -> a built in function to include external modules that exist in seperate files.

module.exports a special object

by default module.exports sends empty object

index.js , 03.js

EXPORT IN DIRECTORIES

the require finds the index.js file and this is the entry point for the directory

04.js 

NPM -> node package manager
npmjs.com

this is the standard packages for Node js (library of packages)
packages are the codes made by other developers which we can use

this is also a command line tool , this is pre installed with node

INSTALLING PACKAGES 

npm install <name of the package>

the scope of the package is just inside the directory in which it is installed

node_modules -> the node modules folder contains every installed dependency for your project

package-lock.json -> it records the exact version of every installed dependency. Inclusing its sub-dependencies and their versions

npm i figlet to install figlet


Packgae.json -> the package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version and dependencies

npm init -> to initialize the package.json

we can share package.json to share all the dependency file info

we can also install packages globally
npm i -g <name of the package>


04.js, math2.js

IMPORT MODULES 
using the export and the import keyword

we have to add "type" : "module" in package.json to use import, export

require vs import

we can't selectively inport the needed piecces with require. w can selectively load pieces with inport which saves memory

loading is synchronous for require but can be asynchronous for import

there are some npm packages which we can import directly , e.g. random-words
