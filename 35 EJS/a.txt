Templating

EJS (Embedded JS templates)

EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JS

if there are multiple pages with same HTMl markup we use templating.
this is like a blueprint

other tools are handlebars

01.js , dice.ejs , home.ejs
npm i ejs

we need not require EJS in js file as Express by default requires it

also all the HTMl templetes must be in the views directory 

Interpolation syntax

it irefers to the embedding expressions into the markup text

02.js , instagram.ejs


creating a basic template for the route /ig/:username

03.js , insta.ejs

rendering data from data.json

Serving static files 

app.user (express.static ( folder_name))

INCLUDES

this allows us to create sub templates
