REACT -> A JS library for creating user interfaces 
documentation -> react.dev , created by meta

React increases the reusability, Atlassian website is completely built on REACT 

A componet is a reusable piece of code 

the components form a heiarchy 

JSX -> javascript extention syntax

it lets us write HTMl directly inside JS
JSX is transpiled to JS by using BABLE

Setting up REACT 

create-React-App  v/s Vite 

Vite is faster 
npm create vite@latest

to run the application : npm run dev

in the react folder . there are differnt files 

1. the git ignore file is to ignore the things posted on git 
2. the eslint file is for formatting
3. index.html is the basic html file this is the homepage
the root div is present here. everything renders inside this 


there is a public folder and a src folder 

the src folder contains the assets folder
and 4 files 

1. App.jsx -> this is the main component , this is the main parent comp. 
2. App.css -> this contains the styles for the App.jsx
3. main.jsx -> here we access the root div
4. index.css -> this is the styling file for the index.html 

index.html -> main.jsx -> app.jsx (basic flow) 


Creating a component 

Component is the reusable independent piece of code 

creation : function Title() {
    return (
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
    );
}

rendering:
<Title></Title> 

IMPORT - EXPORT 

Import -> import Title from "./Title.jsx";

default export -> export default Title;


for multiple exports
Named Export -> export {Title} , 

import (Title) from "./Title.jsx";

Writing markup in jsx

1. Return a single root element
2. Close all the tags 
3. camelCase most of the things 
instead of class use className 

React Fragment 

it lets you group a list of children  without adding an extra node to the DOM 

<> 
<Title/>
<Title/>
<Title/>
</>

JSX with curly braces :

inside the JSX we can use curly braces to write the pure JS code 

<p> 2 * 2  = {2*2} </p>

Structuring Componets 

Style components 

we divide the styling in different files 
then we use webpack to import and export files
